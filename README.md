# DynamicFootballRAG
This repository showcases a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework for football analytics, leveraging spatio-temporal and opponent-relative metrics. Tested on Bundesliga data, it achieved 63.3% accuracy, excelling in temporal and spatial queries (70%), offering dynamic, context-rich insights for analysts and coaches.

A paper describing the approach will be published shortly.
